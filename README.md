# Gender-classification-challenge

This the gender classification challenge which was given by Siraj. To know more, you can watch his this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg .


In this challenge we had to use 3 models to predict whether the given measurements belonged to male or female. In exception to decision tree classifier, I used the following models and this is the prediction given by them for the same data.

| Models Used          | Predicted Result |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Decision Tree        | Male             |
| Logistic Regression  | Female           |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes | Male             |
| K Nearest Neighbors  | Male             |

I used scilit-learn or sklearn and Python 3.6
